    Food and water are essential for life, providing the energy and nutrients our bodies need to function. Food supplies
    carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals, which support growth, repair, and overall health. Water, on
    the other hand, keeps the body hydrated, helps regulate temperature, aids digestion, and transports nutrients and
    waste. Together, a balanced intake of food and sufficient water is crucial for maintaining energy, preventing
    illness, and supporting every bodily function.
