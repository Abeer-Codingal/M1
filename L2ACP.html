    <h1>Horse Riding</h1>
    <p>Horse riding is an exciting and graceful activity that builds a strong bond between the rider and the horse. It
        requires
        balance, control, and trust, as both work together to move smoothly and confidently. Riding a horse not only
        improves
        physical strength and posture but also brings a sense of freedom and relaxation. Whether done for sport, travel,
        or fun,
        horse riding teaches patience, discipline, and respect for animals. </p>
