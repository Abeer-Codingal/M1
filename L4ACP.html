        <h2>Pakistani cuisine</h2>
        <p>Pakistani cuisine is rich, flavorful, and diverse, reflecting the country’s culture and traditions. It
            combines aromatic
            spices, herbs, and fresh ingredients to create dishes full of taste and color. Popular foods include
            biryani, kebabs,
            nihari, and samosas, often enjoyed with naan or roti. Each region adds its own twist — from the spicy
            curries of Punjab
            to the savory rice dishes of Sindh and the hearty meals of the north. Pakistani cuisine is known for its
            warmth and
            hospitality, bringing families and friends together over delicious food.</p>

            Generally, seasonal fruits serve as the most common form of dessert consumed after dinner.
            Pakistani desserts are sweet foods and dishes that are served with tea, usually during the meal, or at the
            end
            of meals in Pakistani cuisine.
